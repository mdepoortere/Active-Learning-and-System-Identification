# Bayesian active learning for fast image selection

This repository is code written during an internship in the lab of Fabian Sinz at the university of TÃ¼bingen.
The goal is to use from active learning with Bayesian deep learning and ensembling to discover which images are maximally informative when it comes to training models for the mouse visual cortex.
We used dropout-mc and ensembles to quantify model uncertainty and select images.
